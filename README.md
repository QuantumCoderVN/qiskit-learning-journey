# My Qiskit Learning Journey ⚛️

This repository documents my progress, code, and notes while learning quantum computing with IBM's Qiskit SDK.

## 📂 Repository Structure

-   **`1_quantum_circuits`**: Introduction to the fundamentals, including building quantum circuits, understanding basic gates, and using simulators.
-   **`2_quantum_algorithms`**: Implementations of foundational quantum algorithms.
-   **`3_real_hardware`**: Guides on connecting to and running jobs on real IBM Quantum hardware, including handling noise and error mitigation.
-   **`4_projects`**: A space for personal projects to apply learned concepts.
-   **`assets`**: Contains images and diagrams generated from the notebooks.

## 🚀 Getting Started

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/qiskit-learning-journey.git](https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/qiskit-learning-journey.git)
    cd qiskit-learning-journey
    ```

2.  **Create and activate a virtual environment:**
    ```bash
    python -m venv .venv
    # On macOS/Linux
    source .venv/bin/activate
    # On Windows
    # .venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

3.  **Install the required packages:**
    ```bash
    pip install qiskit[visualization] qiskit-ibm-runtime jupyter
    ```
